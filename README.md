# ALFS Detection

## Setup

This repository is using code from the [alfs_py project](https://github.com/bambi-eco/alfs_py).

So activate your environment and install alfs_py locally since it is not available on pypi:

```
pip install <path-to-alfs_py-project>
```

In addition, also parts of the [Pipeline project](https://github.com/bambi-eco/Pipeline) are used.

So again activate your environment and install Pipeline locally since it is not available on pypi:

```
pip install <path-to-pipeline-project>
```

Currently only supports Ultralytics models that are hosted in our [Models repository](https://github.com/bambi-eco/Models).
So make sure these models are available as environment variable (c.f. repository readme).
